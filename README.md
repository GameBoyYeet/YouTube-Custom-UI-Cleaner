# YouTube-Custom-UI-Cleaner

Custom css userstyle for **youtube.com** for [Stylus browser addon](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)

Show / Hide ANY useless and unwanted UI elements. Keep what you actually need. 
Less pointless things on your screen!

Pick and hide **ANY** ui element from togglable list. Fast and easy.
Hide things you never use, buttons you never click, features you'll never ever fucking use but you've been constantly looking at for the last 15 years. 
BUT NO MORE! 

Stuff you keep enabled and rest of youtube style and interface stay vanilla and untouched. Keeping changes to absolute minimum.


**Work in progress**. This is literally the very first version of my very first userstyle. 
Still figuring stuff out.

Updates are coming. More UI elements will get progressively added.
If there is some yutube ui element i missed you want hidden (customized in other way) let me know, i can add that.
